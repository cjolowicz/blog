In this third installment of the Hypermodern Python series, I'm going to discuss
how to add linting to your project.[^1] Previously, we discussed [Automated
Testing](../hypermodern-python-02-testing).

## Linting with flake8

{{< figure src="/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote02.jpg" link="/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote02.jpg" >}}

Linters analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors,
and suspicious constructs. The most common ones for Python are
[pylint](https://www.pylint.org), [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org), and
[pylama](https://github.com/klen/pylama). In this chapter, we use Flake8.

Add a Nox session to run Flake8 on your codebase:

```python
# noxfile.py
locations = "src", "tests", "noxfile.py"


@nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
def lint(session):
    args = session.posargs or locations
    session.install("flake8")
    session.run("flake8", *args)
```

Flake8 glues together several tools. Each message is assigned an error code,
prefixed by one or more letters. These prefixes group the errors into so-called
violation classes:

- `F` are errors reported by [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes), a
  tool which parses source files and finds invalid Python code.
- `W` and `E` are warnings and errors reported by
  [pycodestyle](https://github.com/pycqa/pycodestyle), which checks your Python
  code against some of the style conventions in [PEP
  8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- `C` are violations reported by [mccabe](https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe),
  which checks the code complexity of your Python package against a configured
  limit.

Configure Flake8 using the `.flake8` configuration file, enabling all the
built-in violation classes and setting the complexity limit:

```ini
# .flake8
[flake8]
select = C,E,F,W
max-complexity = 10
```

By default, Nox runs all sessions defined in `noxfile.py`, but you can restrict
it to the lint session using the [-\-session
(-s)](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/usage.html#specifying-one-or-more-sessions)
option:

```sh
nox -rs lint
```

There are many [awesome Flake8
extensions](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/awesome-flake8-extensions). Some
of these will be presented in later sections.

## Code formatting with Black

{{< figure src="/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote03.jpg" link="/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote03.jpg" >}}

The next addition to our toolbox is [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), the
uncompromising Python code formatter. One of its greatest features is its lack
of configurability. Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project
you're reading.

Adding Black as a Nox session is straightforward:

```python
# noxfile.py
@nox.session(python="3.8")
def black(session):
    args = session.posargs or locations
    session.install("black")
    session.run("black", *args)
```

With the Nox session in place, you can reformat your code like this:

```sh
$ nox -rs black

nox > Running session black
nox > Creating virtual environment (virtualenv) using python3.8 in .nox/black
nox > pip install black
nox > black src tests noxfile.py
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
5 files left unchanged.
nox > Session black was successful.
```

Invoking `nox` without arguments triggers all the sessions, including Black. It
would be better to only validate the coding style without modifying the
conflicting files. You can exclude Black from the sessions run by default, by
setting `nox.options.sessions`:

```python
# noxfile.py
nox.options.sessions = "lint", "tests"
```

Instead, check adherence to the Black code style inside the linter session. The
[flake8-black](https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-black) plugin generates
warnings if it detects that Black would reformat a source file:

{{< highlight python "hl_lines=5" >}}
# noxfile.py
@nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
def lint(session):
    args = session.posargs or locations
    session.install("flake8", "flake8-black")
    session.run("flake8", *args)
{{< /highlight >}}

Configure Flake8 to enable the `flake8-black` warnings, which are prefixed by
`BLK`. Also, some built-in warnings do not align well with Black. You need to
ignore warnings `E203` (*Whitespace before ':'*), and `W503` (*Line break before
binary operator*), and set the maximum line length to a more permissive value:

```ini
# .flake8
[flake8]
select = BLK,C,E,F,W
ignore = E203,W503
max-line-length = 88
```

## Checking imports with flake8-import-order

{{< figure src="/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote04.jpg" link="/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote04.jpg" >}}

The [flake8-import-order](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-import-order) plugin
checks that import statements are grouped and ordered in a consistent and [PEP
8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports)-compliant way. Imports
should be arranged in three groups, like this:

```python
# standard library
import time

# third-party packages
import click

# local packages
from hypermodern_python import wikipedia
```

Install the plugin in the linter session:

{{< highlight python "hl_lines=5" >}}
# noxfile.py
@nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
def lint(session):
    args = session.posargs or locations
    session.install("flake8", "flake8-black", "flake8-import-order")
    session.run("flake8", *args)
{{< /highlight >}}

Enable the warnings emitted by the plugin (`I` like *import*). 

```ini
# .flake8
[flake8]
select = BLK,C,E,F,I,W
```

Inform the plugin about package names which are considered local:

```ini
# .flake8
[flake8]
application-import-names = hypermodern_python,tests
```

Adopt the [Google
styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Imports_formatting#313-imports-formatting)
with respect to the grouping and ordering details:

```ini
# .flake8
[flake8]
import-order-style = google
```

## Finding more bugs with flake8-bugbear

{{< figure src="/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote05.jpg" link="/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote05.jpg" >}}

The [flake8-bugbear](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear) plugin helps you
find various bugs and design problems in your programs. Add the plugin to the
linter session in your `noxfile.py`:

```python
# noxfile.py
@nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
def lint(session):
    args = session.posargs or locations
    session.install("flake8", "flake8-black", "flake8-bugbear", "flake8-import-order")
    session.run("flake8", *args)
```

Enable the plugin warnings in Flake8's configuration file (`B` like *bugbear*):

```ini
# .flake8
[flake8]
select = B,B9,BLK,C,E,F,I,W
```

`B9` is required for Bugbear's more opinionated warnings, which are disabled by
default. In particular, `B950` checks the maximum line length like the built-in
`E501`, but with a tolerance margin of 10%. Ignore the built-in error `E501` and
set the maximum line length to a sane value:

```ini
# .flake8
[flake8]
ignore = E203,E501,W503
max-line-length = 80
```

## Identifying security issues with bandit

[Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) is a tool designed to find common
security issues in Python code. Install it via the
[flake8-bandit](https://github.com/tylerwince/flake8-bandit) plugin:

```python
# noxfile.py
@nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
def lint(session):
    args = session.posargs or locations
    session.install(
        "flake8",
        "flake8-bandit",
        "flake8-black",
        "flake8-bugbear",
        "flake8-import-order",
    )
    session.run("flake8", *args)
```

Enable the plugin warnings in Flake8's configuration file (`S` like *security*):

```ini
# .flake8
[flake8]
select = B,B9,BLK,C,E,F,I,S,W
...
```

Bandit flags uses of `assert` to enforce interface constraints because
assertions are removed when compiling to optimized byte code. You should disable
this warning for your test suite, as `pytest` uses assertions to verify
expectations in tests:

```ini
# .flake8
[flake8]
per-file-ignores = tests/*:S101
...
```
