## Conclusion

Thank you for reading this far.

This article is dedicated to my father who introduced me to programming in the
1980s, and who is an avid chess book collector. I saw a copy of *Die
hypermoderne Schachpartie* (The hypermodern chess game) in his bookshelf,
written by [Savielly
Tartakower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savielly_Tartakower) in 1925 to
modernize chess theory. That inspired the title of this guide.
